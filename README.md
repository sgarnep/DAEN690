# DAEN690 - Team A
DAEN 690 Repository for Spring 2025 - GMU
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

Over the past decade, private and public organizations have increasingly sought to implement Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve efficiency and reduce costs. However, according to Ryseff, De Bruhl, and Newberry (2024), approximately 80% of AI projects fail. High failure rates can cost organizations millions of dollars or even result in their closure. Organizations may minimize the risk of failure by implementing the Multi-Dimensional Algorithm Structure (MAS), thus saving valuable resources.

PROJECT GOALS

1. Using web scraping/data mining/NLP, develop a database of AI project successes/failures by North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code.

2. Develop models to compare organizational outcomes when MAS is used and when MAS is not used, by case (identified via web scraping/data mining), and by NAICS code.

3. Provide cost estimations of MAS use versus not using MAS.

4. Identify if MAS could reduce failure rates and if there are any situations where MAS succeeds or fails.

5. Develop a risk rating using a partner-supplied method or a team-developed method.
